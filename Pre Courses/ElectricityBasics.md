## How Electricity Works

Atoms are made of 3 particles, 2 of which are in the nucleus.
- **Neutrons**: No Charge
- **Protrons**: Positive Charge
- **Electrons**: Negative Charge
- **The valent shell**: The outtermost shell
- **Conductor**: Material which valent shell can give electrons to other atoms
- **Insulator**: Material which valent shell is extremely stable

Most metals are conductors. Rubber and Glass are examples of insulators.

To safely use electricity, wrap a conductor (metal) with an insulator (rubber).

Electrons are passed randomly without a closed circuit attached. To utilize wire properly, they must be attached to a closed circuit power source (i.e. a battery). The voltage of the battery will force the electrons to move, flowing in the same direction, trying to get back to the other terminal of the battery.

- **Circuit**: The route electrons can flow along between the two terminals (+ and -) of a power source.
- **Voltage**: Can be thought of as pressure in a water pipe. More volage means more pressure, and more pressure means more water. In the case of electricity, more voltage means more electrons can flow.

Volt = Joules / Coulomb
- **Joules**: Work
- **Coulomb**: Group of flowing electrons

EX: A 9 Volt battery can provide 9 Joules of energy in the form of work or heat per group of electrons that flow from one side of the battery to the other. In this case the current of electrons flow from one side of the battery through the LED light bulb which produces light, and then the electrons flow to the other side of the battery. Therefore, 9 Joules of light/heat is produced by the light bulb.

- **Current**: The flow of electrons, measured in Amperes (Amps), past a single point in a circuit within a set amount of time.

1 Amp = 1 Coulomb
1 Coulomb = 6,242,000,000,000,000,000 electrons per second.

Electrons are negatively charged, they flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal.

- **Resistance**: A restriction to the flow of electrons. This is measured in Ohms.

The thinner the wire, the higher the resistance. The thicker the wire, the lower the resistance.

Resistance to the flow of electrons is different per material. (i.e. copper has less resistance than aluminum).

Resistance also increases with higher temperature.

Resistors: Protect components by restricting the flow of current.
